## About
A single page application where users can post photos and like photos uploaded by other users.

This was a project made for TripleTen's online web development bootcamp.
In this project I migrated the Around the US website, which was made using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to React, where I practised what I was learning about front-end development using React and server integration.
